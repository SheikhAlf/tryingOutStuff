This is a repo for trying out stuff.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed:

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is not installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## Install Dependencies

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
npm install three
npm install --save-dev vite
```

---

## Run the Development Server

From the root folder of the repo start Vite with:

```bash
npx vite
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

Vite supports hot reload, so changes to your files will update automatically.
